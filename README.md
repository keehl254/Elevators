# Building

To build Elevators from source using Gradle:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/keehl254/Elevators.git
   cd Elevators
   ```
2. Run the custom Gradle task:
    ```bash
   ./gradlew shadowJar
    ```
3. The compiled plugin JAR will be located in
   ```bash
   build/libs/
    ```

## Java Version Notes

The core project and all submodules except Hooks are built using Java 11. The Hooks subproject is written in Java 21.
A downgrade plugin is used to compile Hooks into a Java 11-compatible format for use in the final build.
Be sure you have both JDK 11 and JDK 21 installed and properly configured if you're developing or building locally.
